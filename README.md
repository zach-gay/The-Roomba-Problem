# The Roomba Problem
A program about a lonely imaginary robotic hoover that wakes up trapped in an imaginary room needing cleaning. Unsure of what to do next, the hoover simply starts doing what it knows best -- cleaning.

# Prerequisites
- In this README file, anytime you see the term **command prompt**, that is referencing the Windows command prompt. If you are on a Mac, the equivalent of the command prompt would be the terminal. If you on a Linux, the equivalent of the command prompt would be the bash. Use the appropriate command line interface based on your OS.
- Validate that you have Node installed on your system. If you are unsure, see my notes in the **Installing Node** section below.
- Finally, download a copy of this repository and save it to your local file system. If you are tech savvy, clone the repository.

# Installing Node
1. Navigate to the Node.js downloads page found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Download the LTS version of Node for the appropriate OS you are using.
3. Run the executable that is downloaded. Follow the steps as prescribed in the install wizard.
4. After installation, open up your command prompt. Type "node -v" and press enter. The version of Node running on your machine should be outputted in the console.
