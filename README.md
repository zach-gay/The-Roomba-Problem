# The Roomba Problem
A program about a lonely imaginary robotic hoover that wakes up trapped in an imaginary room needing cleaning. Unsure of what to do next, the hoover simply starts doing what it knows best -- cleaning.


# Testing Instructions
1. Read/perform the steps found in the **Prerequisites** section below.
2. After cloning the repository, navigate in the command prompt to the directory in which you cloned the repo.
3. Run the command `npm install`. This will install all dependencies needed to run the program.
4. You are now ready to run the program. Run `node TheRoombaProblem.js <file-name>` where `<file-name>` is a text file containing the roomba problem information. This text file must live in the root of the repository. An example is included with the repository called `input.txt`. To run this example, run `node TheRoombaProblem.js input.txt`.
5. To run more tests, simply create more text files at the root of the repository and run the command found in Step 4 with the appropriate file name.

# Prerequisites
